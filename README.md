# QueSystem by Bjorgeh

**School Project for Fagskolen i Viken - Class Programmering 2020-2024**

## Introduction:

QueSystem is a dynamic queue management system designed as a school project for Fagskolen i Viken. It effectively manages numerical orders in a visually intuitive and interactive manner.

## Features:

- **Interactive Grids:** Easily add numbers to the queue by sliding to the left page. The first grid on the middle page displays the current numbers in the queue.
- **Log Management:** Deleted numbers are not lost; they are archived in the right page for easy tracking.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Numbers are seamlessly movable across grids, from left to right, all the way to the log grid on the right page.
- **Capacity Management:** When a grid exceeds 30 numbers, a blinking message alerts the user. Each grid is capped at displaying 30 numbers at a time for clarity.

## Technologies Used:

- **QML:** The core programming language for the project, offering a rich visual framework.
- **JavaScript:** Used for additional functions and variable management, enhancing the interactivity of the system.
- **Qt Version:** The project is developed using Qt 11.0.3, ensuring a modern and robust foundation.
